          My reflection on the undergrad engineering experience. 
          I came across a few of these articles written by others when I was 
          starting college and found them helpful (so here I am, doing the 
          same to share my perspective with others in a position I was in before).
          
          A little bit about me - I studied electrical
          engineering at UC San Diego, was part of some student orgs, worked
          on-campus, volunteered at a neuroscience research lab, and held
          internships at Intel, Tesla, and Microsoft during my undergrad.
          Obviously, this is all my opinion.

          <div class="panel">
            <h5>
              "Be T Shaped" was one of the best pieces of advice I got near the
              end of my freshman year. The horizontal bar at the top of the "T"
              represents all that you know, and the vertical bar in the middle
              represents the depth to which you know something. I've observed
              that in most engineering curriculums at UCSD, students gain an
              in-depth understanding of their major only. This is not
              sufficient.Â <br /><br />
              Generally there are three main fields of engineering (software,
              electronics, and mechanical), within which there are different
              majors/disciplines. I know there's also bio/chem/nano and many
              others that do not fit into these, but the point is don't limit
              yourself to just one. For example, if you major within software
              engineering, complement that with some electronics fundamentals
              ("People who really care about software, build their own hardware"
              or something like that).<br /><br />
              I could pair different majors and go into how they complement one
              another, but what I've observed is to have a good understanding of
              the digital (software, computing) and physical (electrical
              hardware, robotics, structures) worlds as much as you can.

                These are some books I found helpful during that time.
                Some are technical, others career oriented, and some just for fun.

                <b> My Inventions <i>by Nikola Tesla</i></b><br />
                In the fast-paced and dynamic world of tech, sometimes we forgot
                what it means to invent or why even continue studying engineering -
                this short autobiography reinstills the spirit of innovation.
                <br /><br />
    
                <b> The No BS Guide to Linear Algebra <i>by Ivan Savov</i></b><br />
                A very striaghforward approach to learning one of the most
                fundemental topics in math. At the very least, you will learn how to
                "read" math. Knowing how to read math will expedite your ability to
                grasp concepts, definitions, and theorems in your couses.

                  Cracking the PM Interview
                  <i>by Gayle Laakmann McDowell & Jackie Bavaro</i></b><br />
                Regardless of your intent to purse the PM role or your ability to
                engineer solutions, great teams indirectly seek out people who can
                access the impact and reach of their work both internally for the
                team and externally for users. This book helps you develop that
                mindest through real examples and clear guidance.
