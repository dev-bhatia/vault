          This is my reflection on the undergrad engineering experience and some
          stuff I learned along the way. A little bit about me - I study
          electrical engineering at UC San Diego, was part of some student orgs,
          worked on-campus at the Career Center, volunteered at a neuroscience
          research lab, and held internships at Tesla, Microsoft, & Intel during
          my undergrad. Obviously, this is all just my opinion.

          <br />
          <b>"Be T Shaped"</b> was one of the best pieces of advice I got near
          the end of my freshman year. The horizontal bar at the top of the "T"
          represents all that you know, and the vertical bar in the middle
          represents the depth to which you know something. I've observed that
          in most engineering curriculums at UCSD, students gain an in-depth
          understanding of their major only. This is not sufficient.
          <br />
          <br />
          Generally there are three main fields of engineering (software,
          electronics, and mechanical), within which there are different
          majors/disciplines. I know there's also bio/chem/nano and many others
          that do not fit into these, but the point is don't limit yourself to
          just one. For example, if you major within software engineering,
          complement that with some electronics fundamentals ("People who are
          really serious about software, should make their own hardware" -
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay" target="_blank">
            Alan Kay </a
          >).
          <br />
          <br />
          Sure, I could pair different majors and go into how they complement
          one another, but ultimatley what it comes down to is to have a good
          understanding of the digital (software, computing) and physical
          (electrical hardware, robotics, structures) worlds as much as you can.
          I cannot stress this enough.

          <b>What is Federal Work Study</b>
          This is one of those things that is super simple, but requires someone
          to explain it to you once (at least for me). A work study award is a
          specifed amount the government can pay you if you get an on campus job
          that supports work study. At this job, when you get your paycheck, the
          funds come from the government and not the university. That is until
          your award runs out. Then, your pay comes from the univeristy funds.
          For example, say you recieved a work study award for $1000 for the
          whole school year. You then got an on-campus job that pays $10 / hr.
          Your first quarter, you worked 100 hrs. So, you got paid $1000 in that
          quarter. That $1000 was paid by the government, fulfilling the work
          study award you have. However, the next quarter, you work another 100
          hrs (also earning another $1000). But, since your work study award was
          fullfiled already the previous quarter, the pay for this quarter came
          from the univeristy department you work for. For you, this does not
          mean much since you still get paid for the hours your've worked. It is
          only a matter of where the funds come from to pay you. To learn more
          about work study, refer to

          <b>Why?</b>
          Reasons to work on campus differ for everyone. The 1.5 years I worked
          at the Career Center (3rd - 4th year) was super rewarding, apart from
          getting some extra money to pay for groceries, food, & commuting.

          <b>4 Year Plan(s)</b>
          This is like any other plan...it will change. Two quarters into my
          first year, I stopped following the recommended four year plan and
          made my own instead. The reason: I wanted more project based classes
          with hands-on learning rather than learning only theory. There are
          pros and cons to deviating from the recommended plan. The con: you
          don't take classes consistently with the same people your year (the
          consequence being you have to make more of an effort to get to know
          people each quarter in your classes). The pro: you can prioritize
          classes based on your needs (project based classes, graduating early,
          etc). Looking back, taking project based or application focused
          classes early helps build up your resume with tangible skills and you
          become more capable of builings things sooner, rather than later. Do
          not blindly follow recommended plans.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>(most) textbooks are a scam</b>
          Always avoid purchasing textbooks. Two reasons: professors barely use
          them expect for assigning homework & you'll end up learning more from
          YouTube videos anyways. You can most likely (~95% chance) find a PDF
          of the book online. I want to be very clear - I am not encouraging
          this, just stating a probablity :)

          <br />
          <b>Resume Advice</b> After 1.5 years reviewing resumes at the UCSD
          Career Center, these is what I'd recommend to anybody creating a
          Resume or CV.
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 Page in Length. 1-2 Pages for Masters Students (thoguht try to
              fit it in 1). And for PhD's/PostDocs's you are now creating a CV,
              so any reasonable length is fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              PDF format, but make it on Microsoft Word. ATS systems seem to be
              able to parse PDFs converted form Word better than those from
              Pages or Google Docs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid color. If you really need it try grayscale first. Some
              companies print resumes, and your resume may look drasticlaly
              different when printed in black & white versus in color.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bulleted descriptions should only be only line in length. If you
              really need a second line, it should fill up at least 1/2 of the
              second line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use tables to format sections on your resumes. This will reduce
              white-space and give you more flexibility to organize your
              content. After putting all the text, and formatting the spacing in
              each cell, set the line width to 0 to hide the cell outline.
            </li>
            <li>
              Single column layouts work better than two column ones. This is
              from trial & error.
            </li>
            <li>
              Font sizes for descriptions should be between 10 - 12 pt. 
            </li>

          <b>UCSD College System</b>
          UCSD has 7 colleges at the time of this writing. No matter what
          anybody tells you - no, they are not like the houses in Hogwarts.
          Colleges only matter for two things - where you live on-campus (if you
          decide to) and what your GEs will be. The latter is more important as
          most of campus is pretty nice. Sixth has the easiest GEs, Muir and
          Warren are tied for second, Marshall is just there (very neutral), ERC
          and Seventh have too many required writing classes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Writing GEs</b>
          Regardless of what college you end up in, everyone has to take a
          writing sequence as part of their GEs. Use them to boost your GPA as
          an engineering major. It all comes down to your TAs. These people have
          the most influence on your grades. In writing classes, go to their
          office hours occasionally to get feedback on your work (when, not if,
          you make their suggested changes) you will more likely get a higher
          score than if you didn't go.

          <b>Study/Homework Spots</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Geisel Library (2E, 2W, 1E, 1W) if you're studying with friends or
              a group
            </li>
            <li>
              BioMed Library (kinda underrated) if you need to study alone
            </li>
            <li>Second & Third Floors of Price Center</li>
            <li>Top floor of the Bioengineering building</li>
            <li>The East Room in Mandeville Auditorium</li>
            <li>Study rooms in Galbraith Hall</li>
            <li>
              Any floor at Geisel before 2 PMish; after that it gets eerily
              quiet on every floor up from the 4th.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enigneering labs - super underrated & open 24/7 if you have access
              to them.
